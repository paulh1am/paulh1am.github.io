Myco-Box was fabricated from a 3D model using laser-cut acrylic. Many thanks to my excellent partner <a href="http://www.yuhangchen.com/" target="new">Yuhang Chen</a>

Myco-Box is a project designed to explore and raise questions about empathy, connection and nature in a networked social landscape.
It is an internet-connected mushroom farm with an array of feedback systems and environmental controls.

By linking the natural system of a fungus network with a growing environment controlled by internet data streams, the Myco-Box Project creates a platform for environmental explorations and commentary.

Myco-Box was demonstrated as an IRL twitter bot for Lauren Mccarthy's course Critical API's. It was also used to grow a surprisingly resilient Oyster Mushroom mycelium (pictured).

Systems for heating, cooling, humidifying as well as sensors to monitor environment, allow for internet control over the growing conditions. The smart camera monitors the spread of mycelium throughout the substrate by logging changes in color areas over time.
