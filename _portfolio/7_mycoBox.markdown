Myco Box is a project designed to explore and raise questions about empathy, connection and nature in a networked social landscape.
It is an internet-connected mushroom farm with an array of feedback systems and environmental controls.

By linking the natural system of a fungus network with a growing environment controlled by internet data streams, the Myco Box Project creates a platform for environmental explorations and commentary.

Myco-box was demonstrated as an IRL twitter bot for Lauren Mccarthy's course Critical API's. It was also used to grow a surprisingly resilient Oyster Mushroom network.
