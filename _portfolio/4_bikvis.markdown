Bike Vis is a Citi-Bike trip planner and station forecasting app that I created in Ruby on Rails and BackboneJS with partner Jeff Winkler. It uses a PostgreSQL database of Citi-bike station saturation levels built up over time (a few years by now) to predict if bikes or docks will be available at the desired pick up or destination location.
