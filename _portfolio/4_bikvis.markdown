<a href="http://bike-vis.herokuapp.com" target="new">Bike-Vis</a> is a Citi-Bike trip planner and station forecasting app that I created in Ruby on Rails and BackboneJS with partner Jeff Winkler. It uses a PostgreSQL database of Citi-bike station saturation levels built up over time (a few years by now) to predict if bikes or docks will be available at the desired pick up or destination location (given in Forecasts).
