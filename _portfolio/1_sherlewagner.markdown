Sherle Wagner is a luxury bathroom fixtures company with a passion for unique and elegant design. My partner and I were tasked with redoing their website and online catalog.

The main goals were to showcase a fully re-done set of product images and to match the aesthetics of their newly re-done print catalog.

The website needed to serve as a product catalog for the sales staff as well as for clients, both private customers & interior designers so emphasis was placed on browsing and the search function. Designing an elegant way to browse and filter the extensive line of products was a focus. 
We designed a checkbox-filtering system using AJAX calls and responsive accordion panels.



<div class="col two">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/SW/SW_Nav_2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
		<div class="col three caption">
		We initially included styles and collections in the top level of the side nav but user testing of our mockups showed that it was too cumbersome and confusing. 

		Style checkboxes were added and featured collections were removed from the main product browsing page.
		</div>
	</div>

<br/>
Product lines are grouped into 'styles' reflecting period & aesthetic and the product catalog had to emphasize these and show the wide range of styles while minimizing clicks. 

Featured collections describe bathroom sets in specific matching finishes and styles. 






<!-- <div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>
 -->
