<div class="col three">
Sherle Wagner is a luxury bathroom fixtures company with a passion for unique and elegant design. My partner and I were tasked with redoing their website and online catalog.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/SW/SWshowwide.png" alt="" title="display showcase"/>
	
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Responsive website with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and Bootstrap
</div>

The main goals were to showcase a fully re-done set of product images and to match the aesthetics of their newly re-done print catalog.

The website needed to serve as a product catalog for the sales staff as well as for clients, both private customers & interior designers so emphasis was placed on browsing and the search function. 

<br> <br>
Designing an elegant way to browse and filter the extensive line of products was important. 
We designed a checkbox-filtering system using AJAX calls and responsive accordion panels.

<div class="col one"> <br/><br>

	We initially included styles and collections in the top level of the side nav but user testing of our mockups showed that that was too cumbersome and confusing. 
<br><br>
	Style checkboxes were added and featured collections were removed from the main product browsing page.
</div>

<br/>
<div class="col three">
	We imported products as rows from the company's master products spreadsheet by uploading a .csv and assigned filter values such as 'levers' , 'gold', or 'china' as products were added to the database.
<br>
	In the frontend, Jquery handled showing and hiding products based on filter selections.

</div>
<div class="col three">
Product lines are grouped into 'styles' reflecting period & aesthetic and the product catalog had to emphasize these and show the wide range of styles while minimizing clicks. 

Featured collections describe bathroom sets in specific matching finishes and styles.
