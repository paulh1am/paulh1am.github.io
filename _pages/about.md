Hi I'm Paul! I enjoy designing interesting interactions, building products and solving problems to deliver delightful user experiences. I also play guitar, cook and spend as much time outside as I can.

I have worked as a Product Designer at Warecorp and as a UX Designer at International Rescue Committee. I've also done numerous contract and freelance projects as a designer, developer and product manager. Once I connected a mushroom to Twitter.

I'm located a short(ish) train ride from NYC in the Hudson Valley.
Reach me by email: pshiam@ [that email host from the company that rhymes with fl√ºgel].

Here's a list of things I might be able to help you with:

* End to end Product Design
* UX/UI design
* Design Systems
* Web development with Javascript and React
* Digital design and Animation
