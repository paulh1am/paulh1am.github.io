I am an alum of <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">ITP at NYU (MPS)</a> and the web development bootcamp at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly"> General Assembly</a>.
I have worked as a Product Designer at Warecorp and as a UX Designer at International Rescue Committee. I've also done numerous contract and freelance projects as a designer, developer and product manager. Reach me by email: pshiam@ an email provider that rhymes with fl√ºgel.

Some things I'm pretty good at:

* Product Design & UX/UI 
* Web development with Javascript and React
* Digital Design and Animations
* Design Systems
* Making your technology product idea real
