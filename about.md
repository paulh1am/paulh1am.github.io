I am a designer and developer focusing on interactive products and experiences. As a recent graduate of NYUâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), I am passionate about new media, technology and design. I create work exploring things like IoT, game design, VR, data-visualization and user experience. 

I also completed the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly in NY. 

When I'm not hacking or tinkering I like rock climbing, sketching in notebooks and trying to learn jazz guitar.
