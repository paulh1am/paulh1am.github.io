I am a designer and developer focusing on interactive products and experiences. I am passionate about new media, technology and design and am a recent graduate of NYUâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP). I create work that explores topics like IoT, game design, VR, data-visualization and user experience.  

I also completed the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly in NY. 

When I'm not hacking or tinkering I like rock climbing, sketching in notebooks and trying to learn jazz guitar.
