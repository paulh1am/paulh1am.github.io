<h3>Atomic design system for International Rescue Committee</h3>

<strong>My role:</strong> UX design, prototyping, component-building(HTML/CSS BEM, SASS)


As a designer with the digital communications team at <a href="https://www.rescue.org/">International Rescue Committee</a> I worked on the design and implementation of public facing websites.

In preparation for the organization's digital expansion into  multiple countries, our team created a <a href="https://rpl.rescue.org/latest/">pattern library</a> compiling the CSS and HTML of all our website components in one place to ensure brand consistency across languages and regions. 

<img style="width: 65%; margin: 0 auto;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC_atomic/rpl-icons.png" alt="" title="example image">

One challenge was updating each component of our web patterns to support language-specific affordances such as the length of German words and the right-to-left text direction of Arabic.

We were honored to work with Atomic Design innovator <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frost</a> to complete this project.
