<h3>Atomic design for multi-lingual websites</h3>

<strong>My role:</strong> UX design, prototyping, component-building (frontend development)

For IRC's creation of German and Swedish websites our team launched a <a href="https://rpl.rescue.org/latest/">pattern library</a> of all website components, housing CSS and HTML in one place to ensure brand consistency across languages and regions. One challenge was updating each component of our web patterns to support language-specific affordances such as the length of German words and the right-to-left text direction of Arabic.

We were fortunate enough to work with Atomic Design innovator Brad Frost to realize this transformation.
