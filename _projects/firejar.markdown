FireJar is a an API and web application for sharing for map-based media art.
Exploring how digital interactions can shape our experience of the world around us, this project invites people to share and discover content. 

I made a demo experience that placed the verses to Walt Whitman's "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry" at locations along Brooklyn Bridge to play as users walk across. Stickers along the bridge encouraged interaction.

An early motivation for this project was being able to find videos of street performances, in the locations they occurred, a month or a year later.
