<h3> Music industry-focused social App for networking and gaining fans</h3>

<strong>My role:</strong> UX design (mainly in Figma)

Our team worked with <a href="https://www.fanfairapp.com/">Fanfair</a> to create a new beta version of their mobile app. We re-designed existing prototypes and added new functionality as we iterated on their product vision. The beta version of Fanfair is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fanfair-grow-your-audience/id1610189757">the App Store</a> and for Android.

<strong>Sign in flow</strong>
<br/>
During Signup we needed to take in a significant amount of data and also authorize access to the user's Instagram. We prioritized simpicity, forward momentum (through animated transitions), and brand aesthetics. We also designed new forms and icons.

Arriving at the desired signup flow involved multiple rounds of user flows and a series of wire flow mockups. Below is a screenshot of a user flow marked up with notes mid-update.

<strong>Fansharing</strong>
<br/>
Users have a public profile and a media library where they can add content for other musicians to promote their fanbases with Instagram posts.
By connecting to each other's fanbases they can both gain followers. Fansharing means that they post each other's content simultaneously.

<strong>Functionality</strong>
<br/>
This app is packed with features including a social feed, chat funcionality and a dashboard for managing ongoing fanshares as they are proposed, approved and posted. Designing these components presented interesting challenges and opportunities. <br/>
I am grateful for the part I played in bringing Fanfair into existence.
