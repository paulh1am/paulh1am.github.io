<h3>UX & Interaction Design:</h3>

I was part of the Digital Team at International Rescue Committee. We handled the design and implementation of global websites and completed projects across the organization, providing leadership in the areas of UX and technology. We designed multiple award-winning digital campaigns during the 3 years I was there.
Below are some examples of features we designed and built.

<h3>Graphics:</h3>
<br/>
I created digital assets for use across web, social and video and designed motion graphics and video content. I created and maintained the video graphics template library (Javascript/Adobe Extendscript)to standardize motion titles/graphics across the organization and to pre-design consistent campaigns. 

By switching from keyframes to code we significantly expanded the availability and use of motion graphics.
